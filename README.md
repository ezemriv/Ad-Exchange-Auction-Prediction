# Ad Exchange Auction Win Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of a bid win inside an ad-exchange auction. Using advanced techniques and the LightGBM framework, we strive to surpass the provided baseline performance metrics.

## Project Overview

In the world of digital advertising, ad-exchanges play a crucial role in facilitating real-time auctions between advertisers and publishers. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of winning these auctions, which can significantly optimize bidding strategies and improve overall ad placement efficiency.

Key Features:
- Utilizes LightGBM for building robust and efficient gradient boosting models
- Implements MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking and model versioning
- Incorporates data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques tailored for ad auction data
- Aims to exceed the baseline F1 score of 0.503 and ROC AUC of 0.667
- Provides in-depth analysis and visualizations through Jupyter notebooks

This solution is designed to handle various features related to ad auctions, including floor prices, platform information, device characteristics, and more. By accurately predicting auction outcomes, this model can provide valuable insights for both demand-side and supply-side platforms in the programmatic advertising ecosystem.
